# Tweaks for Haptic OS (XOS / Infinix) – Magisk Module
This module optimizes XOS to the limit
# 📌XOS problems that this module fixes:
- **Animation lags** (especially in the curtain and switching applications).
- **High power** (consumption due to aggressive background processes).
- **Slow sensor response** (delays when touching).
- **Overheating** (during long-term use).
# 🔍 What do these settings give:
- **Smooth animations** – no more lags in the curtain and switching applications.
- **Cold CPU** – fix for throttling on Infinix Note/Hot.
- **Fast touchscreen** – like in top smartphones.
- **Long battery life** – disable XOS analytics collection.
- **Turn on animation even on low-end devices** - animations are disabled on low-end devices
